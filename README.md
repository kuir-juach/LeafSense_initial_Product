# LeafSense - South Sudanese Medicinal Plant Identifier

## Description

LeafSense is a mobile deep learning application specifically designed to identify medicinal plants native to South Sudan. More than just plant recognition, the app preserves and shares traditional knowledge by documenting preparation methods, therapeutic uses, and cultural significance of indigenous flora.

### My Mission
Preserving indigenous knowledge, improving healthcare access, and strengthening communities in South Sudan by leveraging deep learning technology to bridge traditional wisdom with modern innovation.

### Context
South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, faces critical healthcare challenges where over 70% of the population relies on traditional medicine as their primary healthcare source. With limited modern health facilities and widespread poverty, communities depend on medicinal plants for treating conditions like malaria, which affects 5.5 million people annually.

However, this invaluable knowledge is under threat due to:
- Disrupted intergenerational knowledge transfer
- Urbanization and modernization
- Lack of written documentation
- Risk of plant misidentification leading to poisoning

### Solution
LeafSense addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Offline plant identification** using deep learning
- **Cultural knowledge preservation** with traditional preparation methods
- **Bilingual support** (English and Arabic)
- **Low-resource optimization** for rural areas
- **User-friendly interface** accessible to all literacy levels

#### Machine Learning Overview
LeafSense integrates a deep learning model designed to identify South Sudanese medicinal plants based on leaf images accurately. The model was trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), optimized for mobile and offline performance through TensorFlow Lite conversion.

#### Model Architecture
#### The baseline model consists of:
-	Convolutional Layers (3 blocks): Extracts unique leaf texture and shape patterns
-	Batch Normalization: Improves stability and accelerates convergence
-	MaxPooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and computation cost
-	Dropout Layer (0.4): Prevents overfitting
-	Dense Layers: Performs high-level feature interpretation
-	Softmax Output: Classifies the image into one of the known medicinal plant categories
  #### Training Configuration
-	Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
-	Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
-	Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
-	Metrics: Accuracy
-	Image Size: 224√ó224 pixels
-	Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: Configurable (commonly 30‚Äì50 depending on dataset)
  #### Dataset
- Source: Collected and labeled dataset of South Sudanese medicinal plants
- Structure:
- 70% Training
- 20% Validation
- 10% Testing
#### 	Preprocessing: Image rescaling, random rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting for augmentation
#### Model Deployment
- The trained CNN was converted to TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format for mobile compatibility.
- The model runs entirely offline, enabling users in remote areas to identify plants without internet access.
- Inference time is optimized to deliver results in under 2 seconds on mid-range smartphones.
  #### Performance Highlights
- High Accuracy in recognizing locally available medicinal plants
- Lightweight & Efficient for low-resource devices
- Explainable Predictions through top-3 class probability display
